<br>
In this homework assignment, you will be estimating the lower bound of the minimum horizontal stress, the upper bound of the maximum horizontal stress, and the range of possible magnitudes of the maximum horizontal stress given a magnitude of the minimum horizontal stress. These estimates will be based on knowledge of the vertical stress, the pore pressure, and the coefficient of sliding friction. The relationship for faults in frictional equilibrium modified from (Zoback, 2007) is,




<em>S</em>1 −<em>P              </em>2

<em><sup>p </sup></em>≤( (µ+1) +µ)<sup>2 </sup><em>S</em><sub>3 </sub>−<em>P</em>

<em>p                                                             </em>




in which S<sub>1</sub> is the maximum principal stress, S<sub>3</sub> is the minimum principal stress, P<sub>p</sub> is the pore pressure, and µ is the coefficient of sliding friction.




<em>Use the following unit in your calculation: ‘psi’ for minimum horizontal stress and maximum horizontal stress. </em>

The answers will be posted a day after it is due. Numerical entry-type responses have a range of acceptable values and are graded electronically, so please adhere to the value of constants given here. We will specify the units that we want the answer in, so please do not write units in the answer, just write the number.
